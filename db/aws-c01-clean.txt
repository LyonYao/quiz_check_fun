The company wants to implement an AWS service to handle messages between the two\napplications. The sender application can send about 1,000 messages each hour.

SQS provides at-least-once delivery, ensuring that messages are not lost in transit. If a message fails to process, it can\nbe retained in the queue and retried without impacting the processing of other messages. Configuring a DLQ allows for the collection of\nmessages that repeatedly fail to process, providing visibility into failed messages for troubleshooting and analysis. \n \nA is not the optimal choice as it involves managing and configuring an EC2 instance running a Redis, which adds operational overhead and\nmaintenance requirements. \n \nB is not the most operationally efficient solution as it introduces additional complexity by using Amazon Kinesis data streams and integrating with\nthe Kinesis Client Library for message processing. \n \nD, using SNS, is not the best fit for the scenario as it is more suitable for pub/sub messaging and broadcasting notifications rather than the\nspecific requirement of message processing between two applications.\nupvoted 4 times \n B m a r o d i 1 year ago\nNice exlanations always, thanks a lot!\nupvoted 1 times \n B m a r o d i 11 months, 3 weeks ago\nNice explanations always, thanks a lot\nupvoted 1 times \n J e e v a 2 8 1 year, 2 months ago\nSelected Answer: C\nAnswer C, In Question if Keyword have Processing Failed >> SQS\nupvoted 1 times \n B m a r o d i 1 year, 2 months ago\nSelected Answer: C\nsolution that meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally efficient will be option C.
