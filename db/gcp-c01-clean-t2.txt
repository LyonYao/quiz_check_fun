Each account\nshould contain one project for every application\nB. \nCreate two G Suite accounts to manage users: one with a single project for all development applications and one with a\nsingle project for all production applications\nC. \nCreate a single G Suite account to manage users with each stage of each application in its own project \nMost Voted\nD. \nCreate a single G Suite account to manage users with one project for the development/test/staging environment and\none project for the production environment\nCorrect Answer:\n \nC",
  "Topic 2\nQuestion #2\nA few days after JencoMart migrates the user credentials database to Google Cloud Platform and shuts down the old server,\nthe new database server stops responding to SSH connections. It is still serving database requests to the application servers\ncorrectly. \nWhat three steps should you take to diagnose the problem? (Choose three.) \nA. \nDelete the virtual machine (VM) and disks and create a new one\nB. \nDelete the instance, attach the disk to a new VM, and investigate\nC. \nTake a snapshot of the disk and connect to a new machine to investigate \nMost Voted\nD. \nCheck inbound firewall rules for the network the machine is connected to \nMost Voted\nE. \nConnect the machine to another network with very simple firewall rules and investigate\nF. \nPrint the Serial Console output for the instance for troubleshooting, activate the interactive console, and investigate\nMost Voted\nCorrect Answer:\n \nCDF",
  "Topic 2\nQuestion #3\nJencoMart has decided to migrate user profile storage to Google Cloud Datastore and the application servers to Google\nCompute Engine (GCE). During the migration, the existing infrastructure will need access to Datastore to upload the data. \nWhat service account key-management strategy should you recommend? \nA. \nProvision service account keys for the on-premises infrastructure and for the GCE virtual machines (VMs)\nB. \nAuthenticate the on-premises infrastructure with a user account and provision service account keys for the VMs\nC. \nProvision service account keys for the on-premises infrastructure and use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) managed keys\nfor the VMs \nMost Voted\nD. \nDeploy a custom authentication service on GCE/Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for the on-premises infrastructure and\nuse GCP managed keys for the VMs\nCorrect Answer:\n \nC",
  "Topic 2\nQuestion #4\nJencoMart has built a version of their application on Google Cloud Platform that serves traffic to Asia.
