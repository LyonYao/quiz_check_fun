Your team is in charge of creating a payment card  data vault for card numbers used to bill tens of thousands of viewers, merchandise consumers, and season ticket holders. You  need to implement a custom card tokenization service that meets the following requirements:   *   It must provide low latency at minimal cost.   *   It must be able to identify duplicate credit cards and must not store plaintext card numbers.   *   It should support annual key rotation.   Which storage approach should you adopt for your tokenization service?",

In an effort to give customers in Cape Town a better user experience, HRL has partnered with the  Content Delivery Network provider, Fastly. HRL needs to allow traffic coming from all of the Fastly IP address ranges into their  Virtual Private Cloud network (VPC network). You are a member of the HRL security team and you need to configure the update  that will allow only the Fastly IP address ranges through the External HTTP(S) load balancer. Which command should you use?",
