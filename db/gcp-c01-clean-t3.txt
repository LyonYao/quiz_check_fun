  "Topic 3\nQuestion #1\nFor this question, refer to the Helicopter Racing League (HRL) case study. Your team is in charge of creating a payment card\ndata vault for card numbers used to bill tens of thousands of viewers, merchandise consumers, and season ticket holders. You\nneed to implement a custom card tokenization service that meets the following requirements: \n* \nIt must provide low latency at minimal cost. \n* \nIt must be able to identify duplicate credit cards and must not store plaintext card numbers. \n* \nIt should support annual key rotation. \nWhich storage approach should you adopt for your tokenization service? \nA. \nStore the card data in Secret Manager after running a query to identify duplicates.\nB. \nEncrypt the card data with a deterministic algorithm stored in Firestore using Datastore mode. \nMost Voted\nC. \nEncrypt the card data with a deterministic algorithm and shard it across multiple Memorystore instances.\nD. \nUse column-level encryption to store the data in Cloud SQL.\nCorrect Answer:\n \nB",
  "Topic 3\nQuestion #2\nFor this question, refer to the Helicopter Racing League (HRL) case study. Recently HRL started a new regional racing league\nin Cape Town, South Africa. In an effort to give customers in Cape Town a better user experience, HRL has partnered with the\nContent Delivery Network provider, Fastly. HRL needs to allow traffic coming from all of the Fastly IP address ranges into their\nVirtual Private Cloud network (VPC network). You are a member of the HRL security team and you need to configure the update\nthat will allow only the Fastly IP address ranges through the External HTTP(S) load balancer. Which command should you use? \nA. \n \nB. \n \nC. \n \nD. \n \nCorrect Answer:\n \nA",
  "Topic 3\nQuestion #3\nFor this question, refer to the Helicopter Racing League (HRL) case study. The HRL development team releases a new version\nof their predictive capability application every Tuesday evening at 3 a.m. UTC to a repository. The security team at HRL has\ndeveloped an in-house penetration test Cloud Function called \nAirwolf. The security team wants to run Airwolf against the predictive capability application as soon as it is released every\nTuesday. You need to set up Airwolf to run at the recurring weekly cadence. What should you do? \nA. \nSet up Cloud Tasks and a Cloud Storage bucket that triggers a Cloud Function.\nB. \nSet up a Cloud Logging sink and a Cloud Storage bucket that triggers a Cloud Function.\nC. \nConfigure the deployment job to notify a Pub/Sub queue that triggers a Cloud Function. \nMost Voted\nD. \nSet up Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Confidential Computing to trigger a Cloud Function.\nCorrect Answer:\n \nC",
  "Topic 3\nQuestion #4\nFor this question, refer to the Helicopter Racing League (HRL) case study. HRL wants better prediction accuracy from their ML\nprediction models. They want you to use Google's AI Platform so HRL can understand and interpret the predictions. What\nshould you do? \nA. \nUse Explainable AI. \nMost Voted\nB. \nUse Vision AI.\nC. \nUse Google Cloud's operations suite.\nD. \nUse Jupyter Notebooks.\nCorrect Answer:\n \nA",
  "Topic 3\nQuestion #5\nFor this question, refer to the Helicopter Racing League (HRL) case study. HRL is looking for a cost-effective approach for\nstoring their race data such as telemetry. They want to keep all historical records, train models using only the previous\nseason's data, and plan for data growth in terms of volume and information collected. You need to propose a data solution.\nConsidering HRL business requirements and the goals expressed by CEO S. Hawke, what should you do? \nA. \nUse Firestore for its scalable and flexible document-based database. Use collections to aggregate race data by season\nand event.\nB. \nUse Cloud Spanner for its scalability and ability to version schemas with zero downtime. Split race data using season as\na primary key.\nC. \nUse BigQuery for its scalability and ability to add columns to a schema. Partition race data based on season. \nMost Voted\nD. \nUse Cloud SQL for its ability to automatically manage storage increases and compatibility with MySQL. Use separate\ndatabase instances for each season.\nCorrect Answer:\n \nC",
  "Topic 3\nQuestion #6\nFor this question, refer to the Helicopter Racing League (HRL) case study. A recent finance audit of cloud infrastructure noted\nan exceptionally high number of \nCompute Engine instances are allocated to do video encoding and transcoding. You suspect that these Virtual Machines are\nzombie machines that were not deleted after their workloads completed. You need to quickly get a list of which VM instances\nare idle. What should you do? \nA. \nLog into each Compute Engine instance and collect disk, CPU, memory, and network usage statistics for analysis.\nB. \nUse the gcloud compute instances list to list the virtual machine instances that have the idle: true label set.\nC. \nUse the gcloud recommender command to list the idle virtual machine instances. \nMost Voted\nD. \nFrom the Google Console, identify which Compute Engine instances in the managed instance groups are no longer\nresponding to health check probes.\nCorrect Answer:\n \nC"
